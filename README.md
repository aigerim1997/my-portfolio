The goal of this project was to identify the most important factors in predicting whether a person who likes Star Wars is also a fan of the Star Trek franchise. As part of this project, a trade-off between interpretability and predictive power has been examined by comparing two methods: logistic regression with lasso regularization, which is pretty straightforward to interpret, and random forest, which gives better prediction results but is more 'black-box' and thus requires model agnostic methods to make the model interpretable.

In this project, an artificial neural network (ANN) was used to classify online shoppers according to their
intentions to make a purchase, the research objective being: “To predict whether an e-commerce customer
will finalize their purchase using clickstream data, as accurately as possible.” This is an individual project which was aimed at introducing myself to deep learning, learn how to train, tune and test a feedforward neural network, and to familiarize myself with the Keras package.

# Clustering

### <span style="color:black"> Segmentation of Coffee Drinkers on Campus Using Latent Class Analysis (LCA) </span> <a href="https://github.com/aigerim1997/my-portfolio/tree/master/clustering-lca" target="_blank"> (View Code) </a>
This project was done in a team of 4, where we conducted a survey and used Latent Class Analysis (LCA) clustering technique to identify segments of coffee drinkers at Erasmus University campus. In this research, we assessed what groups and which characteristics can be distinguished based on attributes that students at the Erasmus University find important when buying coffee. LCA was preferred over other clustering techniques since it is suitable for working with categorical variables, which were prevalent in the survey data (available on GitHub).

A model with two clusters was chosen since that is the best model both in terms of statistical fit (lowest BIC value) and business utility (balanced clusters, more interpretable). The first cluster was identified as ‘Foodies’, since they value the ability to buy food and quality over other importance ratings. In addition, this group consisted mostly of Bachelor students who, in general, do not often buy coffee on campus. The second segment was identified as ‘Lazy’, as distance was the most important consideration for this group. These students are usually Master students who only drink coffee for the caffeine or out of habit. 

In conclusion, a recommendation for the fictional coffee provider on campus was that both segments could be targeted by a specific marketing strategy. In order to attract more “Foodies”, the provider can increase the quality of coffee or offer combo deals that promote, for example, discounts when buying both food and coffee. In order to attract more “Lazy” students, an additional coffee machine could be placed in close proximity to popular study places as this segment finds distance very important.
